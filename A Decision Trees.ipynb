    "\n",
    "- KNN and Naive Bayes are instance-at-a-time classifiers:  \n",
    "  - Given a new instance, they use training set to predict class label \n",
    "  - KNN uses the specific training instances to predict and Naive Bayes uses the learned probabilities.  \n",
    "  - In both cases, it’s hard to see why a particular prediction was made.\n",
    "  - Predictions are highly dependent on the specific instance (its attribute values). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees are rule-based classifiers:  \n",
    "  - Build a set of general rules from the training data.  \n",
    "  - Predictions are made using the rules, not the raw training instances.  \n",
    "  - It is highly interpretable, you can see exactly why a prediction was made by following the tree from root to leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules are basic if-then statements:\n",
    "\n",
    ">IF $att_1 = val_1^1 \\wedge att_2 = val_1^2 \\wedge ...$ THEN $class = label_1$\n",
    "\n",
    ">IF $att_1 = val_2^1 \\wedge att_2 = val_2^2 \\wedge ...$ THEN $class = label_2$\n",

    "\n",
    "The rules are captured in a \"decision tree\"\n",
    "* Internal nodes denote attributes (e.g., job status, standing, etc.)\n",
    "* Edges denote values of the attribute\n",
    "* Leaves denote class labels (e.g., buys iphone = yes)\n",
    "    * Either stating a prediction\n",
    "    * Or giving the distribution...\n",
